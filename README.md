# GUI-Tkinter-Firer-Monitoring-in-Python
Hola chicos en este repositorio encontraran toda la programacion para ejecutar sus propios algoritmos de vision artificial en el GUI de Tkinter

### Project scheme:
 - The project is based on the installation of fire monitoring towers in open locations. These monitoring towers must be equipped with ESP-32 CAM, which will be responsible 
   for capturing images of the location and sending them to a web server through your Wi-Fi system. For administration, we will have computers equipped with our software and 
   They will be responsible for accessing this web server, processing this image and detecting the presence of fire or not through the OpenCV library.
 - From the moment the fire is detected at the location, an audible alarm is triggered for all people present, in addition to an email sent to the ESP-32 CAM administration. 
   A dashboard was created that contains all the information for image processing and processing in general. We are using Python's OpenCV library which, together with our 
   algorithm, is capable of detecting a specific HSV range. HSV is the abbreviation for matrix, saturation and brightness.
-  In this way, we use specific spectra of the fire to detect it, using this small HSV interval configured in advance. Furthermore, the system will be able to detect whether 
   there is fire present in any image, and if so, issue an alert both sound and email.
